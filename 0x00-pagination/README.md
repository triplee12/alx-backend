# Pagination

Most endpoints that returns a list of entities will need to have some sort of pagination.

Without pagination, a simple search could return millions or even billions of hits causing extraneous network traffic.

Paging requires an implied ordering. By default this may be the itemâ€™s unique identifier, but can be other ordered fields such as a created date.
