Internationalization: Internationalization is the process of designing and building a product so that it can be easily adapted to specific languages and cultures.

Flask-Babel is an extension to Flask that adds i18n and l10n support to any Flask application with the help of babel, pytz and its own copy of speaklater. It has built-in support for date formatting including timezones, as well as a very simple and friendly interface to gettext translations.
